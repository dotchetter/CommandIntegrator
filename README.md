# CommandIntegrator
CommandIntegrator is a lightweight framework for creating applications with Features that use commands in human languages, to bind them with certain methods, by creating a streamlined development structure with automated command parsing, logging, and more.

This code was originally developed in my RobBotTheRobot project and is now extracted to it's own repository. 
Documentation and improved Readme will show up soon.
